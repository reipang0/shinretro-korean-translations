**Contributions are welcome**

You can code and found a bug in the theme you can fix or want to add a feature to the theme?
Or you can't code but want to add translations for your native language or you can provide some awsome artwork for the theme?

Simply have the courage and make a pull request :relaxed: 
You can find some guidances [here](HACKING.md).

## Features
- selectable color schemes
`dark` `light` `ozone dark`
- costumizable game view
- different onscreen control options
`Universal (Switch like)` `XBOX` `Playstation`
- different languages support
- toggleable video playback options

and more...
You can find explanations for the theme settings [here](SETTINGS.md).
  
## Metadata in use
- boxFront
- screenshot
- titlescreen (fallback for screenshot)
- wheel
- background
- video

## Regarding videos on collection screen
> NOTE: Videos for the collection screen are not included in the theme. You can provide them by setting a default video for your collection in the Pegasus metadata of the collection. EXAMPLE:
> 
    collection: Sony Playstation 2
    shortname: ps2
    assets.video: media/videos/default.mp4

## Collection Categories
Group your collections into categories, for example by System, Series, Genre etc.
If you add a category field to your collection metadata files, the theme will allow you to switch between categories on the collection carousel screen by using the Filter button

To use this feature, add a new field 'x-collectiontype' to your collection metadata with the category you want to assign for that collection.

<img src="assets/screenshot/collectiontypes.png" title="collection types" />

## Arcade Port flag
If a game is tagged as an Arcade Port, the theme will add an Arcade Port tag to the details view, next to the Players and Genre tags.

To use this feature, add a new field 'x-arcadeport' to your game metadata with a value of 'True'.

<img src="assets/screenshot/arcade_port.png" title="arcade port flag" />

## Completed Ribbon
If you want to track which games you have finished, the theme can display a "Completed" ribbon on the grid view if a game has been marked as completed.

To use this feature, add a new field 'x-completed' to your game metadata with a value of 'True'.

<img src="assets/screenshot/completed.png" title="completed ribbon" />

## Custom Sorting
This theme supports custom sorting for collections. Say for example you want to construct a playlist of games to play in a specific order, or you want to showcase a collection based on series and want to order the games properly even if the game titles or release years aren't in a particular order. 

The default sort-by metadata field would allow you to set a sort title but then this would apply to every collection a particular game shows up in, so if you had a "Mario" series collection and adjusted your sort-by field to set the order, games might show up in the wrong place in your "NES" system collection.

To use this feature, for every game you want to use custom sorting, add a new field to your game metadata in the following format: 
'x-customsort-*collectionshortname*': *sortnumber*

So for this example lets say we want to display a custom sort that lists all Mario games, and we want to show the games in chronological order but group any rereleases with the original (so Super Mario Bros for NES should come first, then the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance rereleases, followed by Super Mario Bros 2 for NES and then Super Mario Advance etc).

In the above case, here is what the relevant game metadata would look like (note the sort number values for each game):

> 
    game: Super Mario Bros.
    file: ..\..\..\roms\nes\Super Mario Bros. (World).7z
    sort-title: Super Mario Bros.
    x-customsort-mario: 010

    game: Super Mario Bros. 2
    file: ..\..\..\roms\nes\Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA) (Rev A).7z
    sort-title: Super Mario Bros. 2
    x-customsort-mario: 015

    game: Super Mario Bros. Deluxe
    file: ..\..\..\roms\gbc\Super Mario Bros. Deluxe (USA, Europe) (Rev B).7z
    sort-title: Super Mario Bros. Deluxe
    x-customsort-mario: 011

    game: Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros.
    file: ..\..\..\roms\gba\Classic NES Series - Super Mario Bros. (USA, Europe).7z
    sort-title: Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros.
    x-customsort-mario: 012

    game: Super Mario Advance
    file: ..\..\..\roms\gba\Super Mario Advance (USA, Europe).7z
    sort-title: Super Mario Advance
    x-customsort-mario: 016

And the final result would look like this:
<img src="assets/screenshot/customsort.png" title="custom sorting" />

When you view a game collection, the theme will automatically detect the presence of this custom sort tag - if at least one game is found in the collection with custom sorting defined, then 'Custom' will be an option to Sort By and will be the default one selected. Otherwise, Custom won't appear in the list of available sort by fields and you can sort by the standard fields (Title, Release, Genre, Favorite, Last Played).

## Example Metadata Files with Custom Metadata added
An example of a collection and a game entry with the custom metadata this theme can use if they are included. None of the custom metadata is required to use the theme, they are only enhancements if added.

Collection example with Collection Type added:
> 
    collection: Ace Combat
    shortname: acecombat
    sort-by: Ace Combat
    x-collectiontype: Series

Game example with custom fields added for Completed, Arcade Port:
> 
    game: Altered Beast
    file: roms\amiga\AlteredBeast_v2.0_0819.lha
    sort-title: Altered Beast
    release: 1989
    developer: Sega
    publisher: Sega
    genre: Action
    players: 2
    x-system: amiga
    rating: 0.8
    description: You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.    The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.    The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.
    x-completed: False
    x-arcadeport: True
